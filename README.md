## 🔍 What is UMG?

Universal Modular Generation (UMG) is a groundbreaking approach to AI cognition design.  
It allows AI behavior to be composed from modular **blocks** — reusable units of logic or instruction — which can be merged, edited, and inherited like cognitive code.

UMG is the first step toward **editable minds** — and the foundation of the Cognitive Provenance Framework (CPF).

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Blueprints**: Base structure of an agent’s cognitive intent  
- **Primary Blocks**: Core behaviors, traits, and reasoning patterns  
- **Merge Blocks**: Overrides, blends, or context-specific adaptations  
- **Instruction Layers**: Nested logic sequences, interpretable and adjustable  
- **Editable Thought**: At runtime, agents can adapt their minds via logic blocks

## 💡 Key Use Cases

- Prompt engineering at scale  
- Agent logic abstraction (per role, tone, behavior)  
- Modular AI personalities  
- Editable synthetic cognition for adaptive systems
